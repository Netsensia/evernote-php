    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    We're going to the circus!
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.
