    A future Conservative government would freeze benefits paid to people of working age for two years, Chancellor George Osborne has told the Conservative Party conference.

Mr Osborne said the proposed freeze, which would not include pensions, disability benefits and maternity pay - would save 3 billion.

It would come into effect in 2016, if the Tories win the next election.

Labour said Mr Osborne was standing up "for the very wealthiest few".

In his speech to the conference, Mr Osborne said it would be "a serious contribution to reduce the deficit".

The chancellor also pledged to scrap the 55% cent tax rate on inherited pension funds.

And he pledged to "put a stop" to the "extraordinary lengths" to which he said some technology companies went in order to avoid paying tax.

There is nothing George Osborne likes more than making twin pack announcements designed to make him look tough but fair.

So it is that he has just announced that a future Conservative government would freeze benefits paid to people of working age for two years at the same time as what will quickly become known as the "Google Tax" - a crackdown on what accountants and tax lawyers call the double Irish arrangement - a tax avoidance strategy that multinational corporations use to lower their corporate tax liability first used by Apple.

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.
            
       Mr Osborne said it was a "dangerous fallacy" that the link between economic prosperity and people's personal finances had been broken.

The welfare freeze would include Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, Child Tax Credit and Working Tax Credit, Child Benefit and Employment Support Allowance, paid to those judged capable of work.

The 55% tax currently applies to untouched "defined contribution" pension pots left by those aged 75 or over, and to pensions from which money has already been withdrawn.

Inheritors will now only pay the marginal income tax rate, or no tax at all if the deceased was under 75 and the pension is left untouched.

The Treasury predicts the new policy will cost approximately 150m per year.

The idea was first floated in July, when a consultation was launched.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?
    
    The end of the 55% tax charge will be a significant gain for some.

But the question Mr Osborne will have to answer is whether he is creating a way for better-off savers to escape tax.

They will have an incentive to use money stored in bank accounts and investments before dipping into the pension pot.

The reason? The pension will become a way of protecting up to 1.25m from some or all tax after death.

Those on lower incomes, who can't save much, and need the money during retirement, have not been in danger of paying the 55% and are unlikely to benefit from its removal.

Some experts say the Osborne reforms turn pension saving on its head.

The point used to be to spread your income over your lifetime.

In future, pensions could become a method of preserving savings beyond the grave.

line
The government estimates that the scrapping of the 55% rate is likely to affect 320,000 people. It is the latest in a string of changes to pension regulations introduced by George Osborne.

In March's Budget, the chancellor announced that pensioners would have the freedom to cash in as much or as little of their pension pot as they wanted, removing the need to buy an annuity.

The latest measure will apply to all inherited pensions received from April 2015.

The beneficiaries of anyone who dies before that date may also benefit from the tax cut, if payment is delayed until after the new policy comes into effect.

It says 12 million Britons have some form of defined contributions pensions saving.

Spouses and financially dependent children under the age of 23 are already exempt from the 55% tax, but the new policy introduces the following changes:

When the deceased is 75 or over, beneficiaries will only have to pay their marginal income tax rate, and only when they take money out of the pension. There will be no restrictions on how much of the fund can be withdrawn at any one time.
Tax-free access to the pension pot of those who die under 75, to any beneficiary, including if the pension is already in "drawdown", meaning income has been drawn from the fund while it is still being invested.
For Labour, Chris Leslie, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said Mr Osborne had "said nothing about the squeeze on real earnings".

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Iraqi ground forces, backed by air strikes, appear to have halted advancing Islamic State (IS) militants in a key town near Baghdad.

The BBC's Lyse Doucet in the Iraqi capital says the air strikes followed clashes with IS militants, who have been making gains towards the capital.

Amariya al-Falluja, 40km (25 miles) from Baghdad, is a key strategic town.

It comes as a US-led coalition continues to carry out air strikes on IS targets in Syria and Iraq.

The area around Ameriyat al-Falluja is now said to be calm, but there is a standoff along the main road to Falluja to the north, which is controlled by IS, our correspondent says.

In an US television interview on Sunday, President Obama candidly admitted the US had "underestimated" the threat of IS.

He said a political solution - one that would arise out of an accommodation between Sunni and Shia populations - was key to defeating the jihadists.

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    * Meeting Notes *

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    TODO:
    * Nail down authentication mechanism

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;

        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,

    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    TODO:
    * Nail down authentication mechanism

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    * Meeting Notes *

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    TODO:
    * Nail down authentication mechanism

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    * Nail down authentication mechanism

    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;

        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;

          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    * Nail down authentication mechanism

    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)

    O Captain! my Captain! our fearful trip is done,
    The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won,
    The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,
    While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring;
      But O heart! heart! heart!
        O the bleeding drops of red,
          Where on the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;
    Rise up - for you the flag is flung - for you the bugle trills,
    For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths - for you the shores a-crowding,
    For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;
      Here Captain! dear father!
        This arm beneath your head!
          It is some dream that on the deck,
            You've fallen cold and dead.

    My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still,
    My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will,
    The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done,
    From fearful trip the victor ship comes in with object won;
      Exult O shores, and ring O bells!
        But I with mournful tread,
          Walk the deck my Captain lies,
            Fallen cold and dead.

    Gliding o'er all, through all,
    Through Nature, Time, and Space,
    As a ship on the waters advancing,
    The voyage of the soul - not life alone,
    Death, many deaths I'll sing.

    Listen, my children, and you shall hear
    Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
    On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;
    Hardly a man is now alive
    Who remembers that famous day and year.

    Should you ask me, whence these stories?
    Whence these legends and traditions,
    With the odors of the forest
    With the dew and damp of meadows,
    With the curling smoke of wigwams,
    With the rushing of great rivers,
    With their frequent repetitions,
    And their wild reverberations
    As of thunder in the mountains?

    Of Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit
    Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast
    Brought Death into the World, and all our woe,
    With loss of EDEN, till one greater Man
    Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat,
    Sing Heav'nly Muse, that on the secret top
    Of OREB, or of SINAI, didst inspire
    That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed,
    In the Beginning how the Heav'ns and Earth
    Rose out of CHAOS: Or if SION Hill
    Delight thee more, and SILOA'S Brook that flow'd
    Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence
    Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song,
    That with no middle flight intends to soar
    Above th' AONIAN Mount, while it pursues
    Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime.
    And chiefly Thou O Spirit, that dost prefer
    Before all Temples th' upright heart and pure,
    Instruct me, for Thou know'st; Thou from the first
    Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread
    Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss
    And mad'st it pregnant: What in me is dark
    Illumine, what is low raise and support;
    That to the highth of this great Argument
    I may assert th' Eternal Providence,
    And justifie the wayes of God to men.

    April is the cruellest month, breeding
    Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
    Memory and desire, stirring
    Dull roots with spring rain.
    Winter kept us warm, covering
    Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
    A little life with dried tubers.
    Summer surprised us, coming over the Starnbergersee
    With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
    And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
    And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
    Bin gar keine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.
    And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
    My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
    And I was frightened. He said, Marie,
    Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
    In the mountains, there you feel free.
    I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.

    Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon
    You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-
    With "I have saved this afternoon for you";
    And four wax candles in the darkened room,
    Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,
    An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb
    Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.
    We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole
    Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips.
    "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul
    Should be resurrected only among friends
    Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom
    That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."
    -And so the conversation slips
    Among velleities and carefully caught regrets
    Through attenuated tones of violins
    Mingled with remote cornets
    And begins.

    Anders thinks we should use a nosql db for document storage, pablo prefers postgres +
    disk. No decision yet.

    Questions came up about what the main workflow will be in the app - some confusion
    around whether it will be file or document (???) focused.

    TODO:
    * Nail down authentication mechanism
    * Decide on language & application server

    The Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
    Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
    To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
    He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

    Famed for their civil and domestic quarrels
    See heartless Henry lies by headless Charles;
    Between them stands another sceptred thing,
    It lives, it reigns - "aye, every inch a king."
    Charles to his people, Henry to his wife,
    In him the double tyrant starts to life:
    Justice and Death have mixed their dust in vain.
    The royal Vampires join and rise again.
    What now can tombs avail, since these disgorge
    The blood and dirt of both to mould a George!

    Unhappy Dives! in an evil hour
    'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
    Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
    Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
    In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
    How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
    But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
    Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

    Facing west from California's shores,
    Inquiring, tireless, seeking what is yet unfound,
    I, a child, very old, over waves, towards the house of maternity,
        the land of migrations, look afar,
    Look off the shores of my Western sea, the circle almost circled;
    For starting westward from Hindustan, from the vales of Kashmere,
    From Asia, from the north, from the God, the sage, and the hero,
    From the south, from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands,
    Long having wander'd since, round the earth having wander'd,
    Now I face home again, very pleas'd and joyous,
    (But where is what I started for so long ago?
    And why is it yet unfound?)
